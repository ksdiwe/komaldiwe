In an age where technology meets entertainment, we&amp;rsquo;ve created a Streamlit-based chatbot that delves into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This interactive platform is not just a chatbot; it&amp;rsquo;s a portal for fans to engage with their favorite characters and stories.
( I&amp;rsquo;m a Marvel fan girls 😛 )
Development Tools and Technologies Using Python and Streamlit, this application showcases the ease of creating interactive web applications. It integrates conversational AI capabilities with OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s language models, ensuring engaging and informative Q&amp;amp;A sessions about Marvel movies and lore.</description>

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills.</description>

Approach:
I first filtered the data by considering only those users who have rated more than 200 books and only those books that have received more than 50 ratings. This step helped in reducing the noise and sparsity in the data by focusing on users and books that have a significant number of ratings. Next, calculated the similarity scores between the books using the Euclidean distance similarity measure.</description>

      <description>A book recommender system is a tool that helps users discover new books to read based on their reading preferences. It works by analyzing users’ reading behavior and recommending books similar to those they have read in the past.
Imagine you have just finished reading a book, and you’re looking for your next read. You go to your favorite online bookstore and start browsing, but there are so many options, and you’re not sure what to pick.</description>

      <description>YouTube Dashboard
I was so amazed by how easy and simple it is to create dashboards with streamlit.
While browsing YouTube, I stumbled upon a video by Thu Vu showcasing the potential of the YouTube API to create an interactive Python dashboard.
The idea intrigued me, and I felt compelled to experiment with it myself. Eventually, I decided to use the API to analyze and display data on various Data Science channels.</description>
