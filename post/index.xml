Approach:
I first filtered the data by considering only those users who have rated more than 200 books and only those books that have received more than 50 ratings. This step helped in reducing the noise and sparsity in the data by focusing on users and books that have a significant number of ratings. Next, calculated the similarity scores between the books using the Euclidean distance similarity measure.</description>

      <description>YouTube Dashboard
I was so amazed by how easy and simple it is to create dashboards with streamlit.
While browsing YouTube, I stumbled upon a video by Thu Vu showcasing the potential of the YouTube API to create an interactive Python dashboard.
The idea intrigued me, and I felt compelled to experiment with it myself. Eventually, I decided to use the API to analyze and display data on various Data Science channels.</description>
